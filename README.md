# employee-database-python
Python-based OOP project simulating an Employee Database system with class inheritance, compensation, and reimbursement logic.

# Employee Database System – Python OOP Project

This project is a Python-based Employee Database System developed for the **MIS 6382 Object-Oriented Programming** course at the University of Texas at Dallas. It simulates a real-world HR application where users can manage different types of employees and calculate weekly compensation and reimbursements using object-oriented programming concepts.

### 🎯 Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to apply object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to build a functional and realistic Employee Database System. Through this project, we learn how to design class hierarchies, use inheritance and multiple inheritance, and handle real-world scenarios such as calculating salaries, overtime, and reimbursements. The program simulates a business environment where different types of employees (full-time, hourly, consultants, and managers) have distinct compensation rules. By interacting with a menu-based interface, users can manage employee records, perform calculations, and store results using Python’s file handling capabilities—all within a modular and reusable class structure.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Menu-driven interface with 7 options:
  1. Add a new employee
  2. Display employee information
  3. Calculate weekly compensation
  4. Search employee by name
  5. Show basic statistics
  6. Calculate reimbursement
  7. Save and exit

- Four employee types:
  - Full-Time Employee
  - Hourly Employee
  - Consultant
  - Management (inherits from both Full-Time and Consultant)

- Data persistence using file handling (`empdata.dat`)
- Compensation and reimbursement logic based on real-world business rules
- User input validation and exception handling

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Inheritance and multiple inheritance
- Encapsulation with getters and setters
- Aggregation (`Vehicle` class used in `Employee`)
- File I/O operations in Python
- Modular class-based structure

## 📁 Files

- `Final_Shreya_Madan_Mali.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and logic
- `empdata.dat`: Provided dataset (not modified)
- Output file: Created upon program exit with all current employee records

---

## 💻 How to Run

1. Open `Final_Shreya_Madan_Mali.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run the cells to start the program
3. Interact with the menu options
4. On exit, a new data file is created with the updated records
